===== POKEMON SPRITES FOR WINFETCH V1.0 =====

Heavily inspired by PhoneyBadger's pokemon-colorscripts. Check out their repo as well.

This winfetch config will print pokemon sprites from the two attached folders to Windows Powershell/Terminal.

--------------------

Winfetch can be found here: 

https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch

or using a package manager like Scoop: 

scoop install winfetch

--------------------

Installation: 

Paste the contents to your winfetch directory, e.g. when using scoop to:
C:\Users\YourUsername\scoop\apps\winfetch\current

If you want to keep your current config other than the sprite loader, you can just paste the part of the config that defines the logo, under ===== IMAGE ==== (ln. 363).

There's a chance winfetch will print a shiny, which is set to 1/128 by default.

Have fun!
